Comparative statistical analysis of top interview problems by topics, complexity, and popularity based on [pgmreddy’s list](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1376426/facebook-interview-questions-july-2020-july-2021). This overview may help you choose the optimal preparation strategy and automatically analyze any other tasks, depending on the need.

The complete list of interview questions that I included in the statistics:
* Facebook (Meta) July 2020 — July 2021
* Google Jan — Jun 2020, Jul — Oct 2020
* Amazon July 2020 — July 2021
* Bloomberg July 2020 — July 2021
* Apple, Uber, Flipkart, Swiggy July 2020 — July 2021*

> *Given the small number of tasks for Apple, Uber, Flipkart, and Swiggy, they were all combined into a common database and are referred to as Apple in the text. It should also be noted that premium problems were not included in the statistics.

Each task on leetcode can belong to several topics at once. The tasks in all interview sets have a total of 43 possible topics. If we collect all the problems for each individual set and count the number of mentions of each topic separately, the distribution by topic for each company will look like this:
